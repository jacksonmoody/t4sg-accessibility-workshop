# Tech for Social Good Accessibility Workshop

Welcome! This is the starter code that we will use for the Tech for Social Good Accessibility Workshop.

Use [Axe Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd), along with what you learned in workshop, to improve the accessibility of this site!

To get started, run `npm install` and then `npm run start`. This will start a local server at `localhost:3000` where you can view the site.
